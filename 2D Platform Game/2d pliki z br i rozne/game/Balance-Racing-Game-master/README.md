# Balance Racing Game
This is the source code for a Balance Racing game created during a Twitch livestream.

We use the Unity 2D physics system to create some fun vehicle controls.

Check out my [YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/brackeys) for more tutorials. The livestream will be uploaded there as well.

Everything is free to use also commercially (public domain).
